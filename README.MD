## Introduction

A DAO, which stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a new type of organization (or company) that runs leveraging blockchain technology. This enables us to create more transparent, trusted, and efficient organizations.

**DAOs** are the biggest innovation in the field of governance since the invention of the [LLC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/llc.asp) or perhaps even democracy itself. Just like the **steam engine** made the **Industrial Revolution** possible by harnessing **physical power**, DAOs harness **political power** and make a Web3 revolution possible. This could fundamentally change how we organize resources, people, and capital with the end goal of creating a more stable, flourishing, collaborative, and fair civilization.
