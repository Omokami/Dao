# Motivation

A DAO, which stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a new type of organization (or company) that runs leveraging blockchain technology. This enables us to create more transparent, trusted and efficient organisations.

**DAOs**Â are the biggest innovation in the field of governance since the invention of theÂ [LLC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/llc.asp)Â or perhaps even democracy itself. Just like theÂ **steam engine**Â made theÂ **Industrial Revolution**Â possible by harnessing **physical powe**r, DAOs harnessÂ **political power**Â and make a Web3 revolution possible. This could fundamentally change how we organize resources, people and capital with the end goal of creating a more stable, flourishing, collaborative and fair civilisation.

# Mission

This future is only possible if enough builders stands up and make the dream a reality.

Your goal, if you wish to earn your **Motoko Bootcamp Diploma**, is to build an application that leverages the power of DAOs.

| **Do I need to build a frontend?**                                                                 | - The primary focus is on Motoko. - If you intend to develop a frontend, you'll need to use JavaScript and utilize existing frameworks like Angular, Vue, Svelte, or React. - If you're already experienced in frontend development, feel free to showcase your skills! However, if you're not familiar with frontend development, concentrate on the Motoko aspect and solely work on the backend. When building the guided project, you'll begin with a template repository that includes a pre-configured frontend ready for integration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Do I need to integrate with the Internet Identity?**                                             | - Not necessarily. - A lot of the applications youâ€™ll see integrate with it because itâ€™s easy, efficient, and works well on the Internet Computer. - However, itâ€™s not the only way to authenticate users; you could also use: 1. Wallet-based solutions like [Plug](https://plugwallet.ooo/) or the [Me Wallet from AstroX](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.astrox.me&hl=en_US&pli=1). These are different types of wallets, each offering specific features. 2. [NFID](https://nfid.one/), which builds upon Internet Identity by adding more features such as email login, credentials management, and wallet integration. - It's important to note that these authentication methods are mainly relevant for applications with a user interface (frontend). If your application doesn't have a frontend (refer to the previous question), then integrating an authentication provider is not required. |
| **How to get started, do you have templates?**                                                     | - Yes, there is a template starter for each project in the repository.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
